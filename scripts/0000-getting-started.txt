Hello and welcome to You.Dev

My name is Paul, and I'll be your host for this screencast.

I've been working with computer software and infrastructure for over 20 years.

This screencast is the beginning of an epic journey to becoming a full stack engineer. It's possible to get overwhelmed when starting a task of such magnitude. There are dozens of interconnected concepts, ideas, and languages in full-stack engineering, some of them seeming to be prerequisites of each other at times!

The aim of you.dev is start from a basic level of computer knowledge and slowly branch out into all the separate full-stack disciplines. Topics will be introduced naturally as the need for them arises in our journey.

Our first need as new developers is to get some tools, namely a text editor. Every developer from beginner to expert needs a nice, basic text editor and web browser.

If you are on Apple macOS, a great free text editor is TextMate. If you are on Microsoft Windows, a great free text editor is Notepad++. There are so many editors out there, feel free to explore. At the end of the day, all text editors edit text, as we're about to find out.


Let's:
	Get and install:
		- TextMate
		- Notepad++
	Create New Document in TextMate:

	Dabble in our first language: (html)
		html: all about "tags"
			- begin / end <html> document - write something in it
			- <p>
			- tags control browser behavior
			- two main elements <head> <body>
			- <title> puts the title in the tab!
			- <body>
			- <h1>
			- display of information
	Dabble in our second language: (css)
		css: all about describing how html looks

	Dabble in our third language: (javascript)
		javascript: all about describing how html behaves
